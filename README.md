# SwiftTreeADTDemo

A demo of a ADT (simple binary tree) implemented in Swift. Implements a few functions to test it out 
(`sum` `stringifyTree`, and `indent` (extending `String`).


## Notes

* Currently xCode beta 3 and 4 seem to crash without the use of the `TreeLike` protocol
* Generics don't seem to work with the recursive enum.

Hopefully both of these thigns will be resolved before Swift is out of Beta!
